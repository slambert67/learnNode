Basic Authentication
====================
Associate authentication middleware with a route:
e.g. router.get('/secret', authMiddleware);

user navigates to this route
check for existence of request.headers.authorization

request.headers.authorization does not exist
--------------------------------------------
Send a response:
	res.statusCode = 401;  
    res.setHeader('WWW-Authenticate', 'Basic realm="Secure Area"');
	res.end('<html><body>Need some credentials</body></html>');
	
This header and status code prompts browser to request username/password
username:password in base64 passed back to server in next request
- request.headers.authorization

request.headers.authorization does exist
----------------------------------------
Extract username and password from request.headers.authorization
Check against known credentials - probably in DB
